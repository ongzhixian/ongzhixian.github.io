MS To Do App

We’ll offer a preview version of our new API that supports work, school, and personal Microsoft accounts, 
but note that we will only support delegated access in the first release. 

The required permission scopes are 

    Tasks.Read
    , Tasks.ReadWrite and 
    Tasks.ReadWrite.Shared
    
You’ll find support for the following endpoints:

CRUD operation on TaskList entity	        /me/todo/lists
CRUD operation on Task entity	            /me/todo/lists/<listId>/tasks
CRUD operation on LinkedResource entity	    /me/todo/lists/<listId>/tasks/<taskId>/linkedResources
