# Files

The files in this folder serve as layouts for views.

- _default.html
Default layout

## Naming conventions for layout filenames

Default/common layouts

_default
_material
_skeleton

Then layouts for specific use cases

_default_login
_material_login
_skeleton_login

_material_error
_skeleton_error


## Notes

Yes, I realise it is not particularly meaningful to name a layout as 'default' layout.
In my case, default refers to whichever framework I'm using at the time to firm out the 
changes made to the layouts before replacing the corresponding layout file.
