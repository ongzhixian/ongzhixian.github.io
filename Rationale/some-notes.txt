multiply the production by a random integer from 128 to 383, then divide by 256, rounding down. 
So 11 becomes 5 to 16. Finally, multiply it by 8 to get 40 to 128.)

For an industry that has poor or no service 
    (less than 60% of its cargo is transported): 33% chance of increase, 67% chance of decrease.

For an industry that has good (greater than 60%) service: 67% chance of increase, 33% chance of decrease.



Town growth can be accelerated by loading and unloading at least one item of cargo at up to five stations within town influence within a 50 day period. 
It does not matter which cargos are loaded/unloaded.


If town growth is not funded and the town needs water, food or whatever 
(and has population>90 for subarctic, 
population>60 for subtropic), 
it does not grow at all. 
If town growth is funded, these checks are ignored and the town always grows.

Production of raw materials happens 8 or 9 times per month. 
(It happens every 256 ticks. There are 74 ticks in a day, and 28 to 31 days in a month
